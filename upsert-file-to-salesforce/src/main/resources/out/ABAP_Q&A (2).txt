				Conversions 

1) BDC --- Transaction Processing 
2) BAPI ---- Business Application Programming interface 

3) IDOC ---- Intermediate Document

Sales-->Purchase-->Manufacturing-->Finance Department
SD------>MM------->PP------------->FI/CO

1) Raw material---Scrap for Sulphur---100 KGS.

This is not a file Transfer---Application Transfer.
				ALE & IDOCS

ALE Stands for Application Linking and Enabling where the Application is transfered
across different systems or clients within the organization.
When an application is transfered,the system creates an new notification or number
which is called as Intermediate Document.

Every IDOC is a system defined unique number which is automatically generated when an application is transfered across systems or clients.

Sender System --- Outbound System
Receiver System --- Inbound system

Every IDOC has 3 parts:

1) Control Record ---- Control record will store the information of the technical
details like RFC Destination,Partner Profile,Port No --- It is stored in the
table EDIDC.

2) Data Record ---- Data record will store the information of the data that is
transfered across clients or servers.

   Message Type ---- Structure --- EDIDD.

The data is stored in the form of Segments in IDOCs.
The transactions that are performed in SAP are transfered or mapped in IDOCS as 
Message Types.

Message Type is a collection of several fields in the table.Each tables data
is defined as Segment in IDOCs.

  Some important Message Types that are frequently used:

 1) MATMAS ---- MATERIAL MASTER ---- MM01
    MARA ------ IDOCS----E1MARA
    MAKT ------      ----E1MAKT
    MARC ------ E1MARC
    MARM ------ E1MARM

2) COSMAS ---- COST CENTER ---- KS01
3) CREMAS ---- VENDOR MASTER ---- XK01   
4) DEBMAS ---- CUSTOMER MASTER --- XD01
5) GLMAST ---- GL ACCOUNT MASTER ---- FS00

3) Status Record --- Status record will store the information whether the data
that is send has been received successfully or not.It is stored in the table
-EDIDS.

The Steps that are involved in ALE 

Steps in the Outbound system(Sending System)

1)	Create logical systems ---- BD54
2)	Assign Logical systems to client ---- SCC4.
3)	Create RFC Destination ---- SM59.
4)	Create Port ---- WE21--BASIS
5)	Create Partner Profile --- WE20---ABAP Consultant
6)	Create Distribution Model --- BD64.
7)	Create material master ---- MM01.
8)	Send Material --- BD10
9)	Check the IDOC Status --- WE02.

 Send material --- BD10
 Get Material --- BD11
 Send Customers  --- BD12
 Get  customer  --- BD13
 Send vendor  --- BD14 
 Get Vendor  --- BD15 

Steps in the Inbound sytems(Receiver system)

1)	Create Partner Profile --- WE20
2)	Get Material --- BD11
3)	Check the IDOC status --- WE02.

If you receive any Errors ,then WE19 --- IDOC 
Testing tool where it is to be processed further.

Reprocess the IDOC ----  BD87

				Custom IDOCS 

1)	WE30 – Assigning the segment to IDOC type
2)	WE31 – Development of custom segments
3)	BD82 – Create custom Message Type
